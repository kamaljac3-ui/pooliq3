# Full Slate — daily update procedure

This file is the complete, self-contained procedure for producing one day's
roundup. Follow it exactly so the site stays consistent day to day.

## 1. Figure out "today"

Run `date -u +%Y-%m-%d` (UTC) to get today's date. If a post for that date
already exists at `sports-roundup/posts/<date>.html`, stop — today's post
is already done, do not duplicate it.

## 2. Gather material, per league

For each of NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, WNBA:

1. Pull the league's ESPN news RSS feed for baseline coverage:
   - NFL:  https://www.espn.com/espn/rss/nfl/news
   - NBA:  https://www.espn.com/espn/rss/nba/news
   - MLB:  https://www.espn.com/espn/rss/mlb/news
   - NHL:  https://www.espn.com/espn/rss/nhl/news
   - WNBA: https://www.espn.com/espn/rss/wnba/news
2. Also do a broad web search for what's actually being talked about around
   that league in the last 24-48 hours. RSS alone under-covers front-office
   drama, contract disputes, suspensions, and off-field storylines — search
   explicitly for those too. **Off-field stories are in scope, including
   relationship/dating news about players, as long as it's a real story
   multiple outlets are actually covering** — not manufactured filler, and
   not anything from a single unreliable tabloid source.
3. From everything gathered, pick the 2-4 most *substantial* stories for
   that league — the ones a genuinely engaged fan would want to know about
   today. Substantial means: trades, signings, injuries, suspensions,
   coaching/front-office moves, contract disputes, retirement news,
   significant game or series results with real stakes, or a widely-covered
   off-field storyline. Skip minor transactions, practice-squad churn, and
   routine game recaps with no broader significance.
4. If a league genuinely has nothing substantial that day, it's fine to
   include just 1 story, or a single short "quiet day" line — don't pad.

## 3. Write it up — copyright rules (non-negotiable)

- Every story is written **in your own original words** — a 2-3 sentence
  summary of what happened and why it matters. Never copy sentences from
  the source article.
- At most one short quote per story, under 15 words, in quotation marks,
  attributed to who said it.
- Never reproduce a full headline verbatim as your story title if the
  source's headline is distinctive — paraphrase it.
- Always link to the original source article so readers can read the full
  story there.

## 4. Build today's post page

Copy `sports-roundup/posts/2026-08-17.html` as a structural template (same
HTML shell, `<link rel="stylesheet" href="../style.css">`, same five
`<section class="league-section LEAGUE">` blocks in NFL/NBA/MLB/NHL/WNBA
order). For the new file `sports-roundup/posts/<date>.html`:

- Set `<title>` to `Month D, YYYY — Full Slate`.
- Set the meta description to a one-sentence summary of the day's biggest
  headline across all five leagues.
- Set `.post-header .date` to the human-readable date and `<h1>` to a short
  punchy headline capturing the day's biggest storyline (not "Daily
  Roundup" — an actual headline, e.g. "MVP candidate out 6 weeks, and a
  trade that changes the AL wild card race").
- Inside each `.league-section`, replace the placeholder `.story` blocks
  with one `.story` div per real story:
  ```html
  <div class="story">
    <h3>Short original headline for this story</h3>
    <p>2-3 sentence original summary.</p>
    <p class="src">Source: <a href="https://...">Outlet Name</a></p>
  </div>
  ```
- If a league has multiple stories, include multiple `.story` blocks in
  that section, most important first.

## 5. Add the entry to the homepage

In `sports-roundup/index.html`, insert a new `.post-card` immediately after
the `<!-- POSTS:START -->` marker (so newest is always first):

```html
<a class="post-card" href="posts/<date>.html">
  <div class="date">Month D, YYYY</div>
  <h2>Same headline used on the post page</h2>
  <p>One-sentence teaser summarizing the day across all five leagues.</p>
</a>
```

Leave every earlier `.post-card` in place below it — this is an append-only
archive. Do not delete or rewrite old posts.

## 6. Commit and push

```
git add sports-roundup/
git commit -m "Add <date> roundup"
git push
```

Pushing to `main` triggers the GitHub Pages deployment automatically (via
`.github/workflows/deploy-sports-roundup.yml`) — no separate deploy step
needed.

## 7. If something fails

If an RSS feed is unreachable or a search turns up nothing usable for a
league, don't block the whole post on it — note it in that section as a
single "Nothing significant to report today" line and continue with the
other leagues. Always still commit and push whatever was successfully
gathered.
